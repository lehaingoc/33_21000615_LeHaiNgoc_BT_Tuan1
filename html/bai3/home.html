        <span style="color: brown;">Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span> all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.
    <p>I've started putting up a <u class="one"><span style="color: blue;">slide show</span></u> of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me.</p>
    <p>Once again: <span style="color: brown;"><i>BRAVO!!!</i></span> -- Mrs. Juroszek</p>
